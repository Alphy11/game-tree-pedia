Any parts of the ability preceded by the word “may” are optional, and the player resolving the ability may choose not to resolve those parts. 1.6 Abilities on components that remain in play are mandatory unless those abilities use the word “may.” 1.7 If an ability has multiple effects separated by the word “and,” a player must resolve as many of the ability’s effects as possible.

A player cannot resolve the effect of such an ability if they cannot resolve that ability’s cost. 1.10 Some examples of an ability’s cost include spending resources, spending trade goods, spending command tokens, exhausting cards, and activating specific systems. 1.11 TIMING 1.12 If the timing of an ability uses the word “before” or “after,” the ability’s effect occurs immediately before or after the described timing event, respectively.

",
                            "• Such an ability typically modifies or replaces the timing event in some way. 1.14 Effects that occur “when” an event happens take priority over effects that occur “after” an event happens. 1.15 If an ability uses the word “then,” a player must resolve the effect that occurs before the word “then” or they cannot resolve the effect that occurs after the word “then.” 1.16 Each ability can be resolved once for each occurrence of that ability’s timing event. For example, if an ability is resolved “At the start of combat,” it can be resolved at the start of each combat. 1.17 If there are multiple abilities that players wish to resolve at the same time during the action phase, each player takes a turn resolving an ability in initiative order, beginning with the active player. This process continues until each player has resolved each ability that they wish to resolve during that window. 1.18 If there are multiple abilities that players wish to resolve at the same time during the strategy or agenda phases, players take turns resolving abilities starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise. This process continues until each player has resolved each ability that they wish to resolve during that window."

This card’s initiative value is “6.” During the action phase, if the active player has the “Warfare” strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability. To resolve the primary ability on the “Warfare” strategy card, the active player performs the following steps: 88.1 STEP 1—The active player removes any one of their command tokens from the game board. Then, that player gains that command token by placing it in a pool of their choice on their command sheet. 88.2 STEP 2—The active player can redistribute their command tokens. 88.3 After the active player resolves the primary ability of the “Warfare” strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool to resolve the “Production” ability of one space dock in their home system.
