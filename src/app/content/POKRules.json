This card’s initiative value is “6.” During the action phase, if the active player has the “Warfare” strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability. To resolve the primary ability on the “Warfare” strategy card, the active player performs the following steps: 99.1 STEP 1—The active player removes any one of their command tokens from the game board. Then, that player gains that command token by placing it in a pool of their choice on their command sheet. 99.2 STEP 2—The active player can redistribute their command tokens."
